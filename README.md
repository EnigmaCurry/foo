# rust-cli-template

This is my Rust template for new CLI apps.

## Use this template

 * [Create a new repository using this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=rust-cli-template&template_owner=EnigmaCurry).
 * The `Repository name` you choose will also be used as your app name.
 * Clone your new repository to your workstation.
 
## Render the template

```
./setup.sh
```
 
This will render the template into the project root and then
self-destruct this README.md and the template.
